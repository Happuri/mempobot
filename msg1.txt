this is announcement of new boards (and freesite) related to secure linux Mempo:

* mempo - Mempo Project â€“ Hardened Privacy (Secure Linux)
* mempo.bot - Mempo Hardened Privacy: verbose details by bot
* linux - Linux operating system

This bot here will post to this boards automatic notifications.

* when Mempo Secure SameKernel for Debian is released in new version
* when Mempo Secure SameKernel for Debian publishes the expected checksum of .deb of kernel (so you can double check)
* (detail) all git commits related to that
* (detail) build process start/stop 

Information (detail) will be posted probably only to FMS board mempo.bot to avoid clutter.

Please subscribe this boards, they should be visible in FMS.
And please try out Mempo.

With regards,
Mempo team

For freedom and privacy.
